# TextEngine

## What is it?
Textengine is a project with the eventual goal of being an easy to use game engine that takes in text files written in a simple pseudo-code that outputs a text based rpg, allowing users to focus on the story they want to tell rather than all the messy functionality code.


## Where is it at?
Currently Textengine is in a very very very early pre-alpha stage with no real functionality, however hopefully this project will continue to be updated and maintained until it is ready for user use.

## Who's working on it?
Textengine is being developed by:  
Project Manager and Lead Dev and Complete Badass: [Abe Severinsen (The Scrawl)](https://github.com/TheScrawl)
