# TextEngine
Python program that generates text based games from text files written in a simple scripting language

## What is it?
Currently, Text Engine is in early early alpha stages, at present it simply is just the framework of a text based game that pulls its data from dictionary based datasets. Despite its lack of any usefullnes or interesting code in its present state, there is a clear plan for what it should do in future.

## What will it be?
Text Engine is going to be a game engine that generates text based RPGs using a quick and easy scripting language or potentially GUI editor, allowing people to flesh out ideas for text based games quickly and easily.

## How do we get there?
There is a bit of a plan for what will be done next, both in long term and short term, it might take a while and its a lot to develop.
### Short term
* Item and Inventory System
* Magic stuff (?)
* Quest system
* Shop system
* Stats and leveling system
* Combat system (probably turn based)
* Intergrate all the systems together
* Probably some other stuff too

At this point users will be theoretically able to write their own text based games using the dictionary system, but I want to make it a bit easier than that.
### Long term
* Tool to autogen dictionary datastructures from simple text files
* graphical tool to generate the text files and visualise the maps and whatnot
* guide on how to use the tool
After these things are done, Textengine will be pretty much what I would consider a "finished" state
### Other things I want to add or potentially do
* A map system
* option to use Ascii art
* Port over to ncurses so it looks a bit nicer

All these things I might add after the game is at what I would consider a "finished" state
